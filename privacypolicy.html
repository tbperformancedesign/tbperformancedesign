If you assert a justified request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless there are other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g. retention periods under tax or commercial law); in the latter case, the data will be deleted once these reasons no longer apply.
</p>      
<h1>
2.4 General information on the legal basis for data processing on this website    
</h1>     
<p>
If you have agreed to data processing, your personal data will be processed on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a DSGVO if special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 para. 1 DSGVO. In the event of express consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also carried out on the basis of Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO.

This consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for the fulfilment of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, your data will be processed on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO.

Data processing may also be based on my legitimate interest according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. Information on the relevant legal basis in each individual case is provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.

<h1>

Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.        
</p>   
<h1>

</h1>

E OR F DSGVO, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS privacy policy. if you object, your personal data concerned will no longer be processed unless compelling legitimate grounds for processing can be demonstrated, which outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing of the validation, exercise or defence of rights claims (objection under Art. 21 para. 1 DSGVO). <br><br>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA ARE PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT ADVERTISING (OBJECTION UNDER ART. 21 para. 2 DSGVO).       
</p>

</h1>      
<p>
In the event of a breach of the DSGVO, data subjects shall have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work or the place of the alleged breach. The right of appeal is without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy.        
</p>    
<h1>
2.8 Right to data portability        
</h1>        
<p>
You have the right to have data that is processed automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfilment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another person responsible, this will only be done insofar as it is technically feasible.
</p>    
<h1>
2.9 Information, correction and deletion
</h1>   
<p>
Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient and the purpose of the data processing and, if applicable, a right to correction or deletion of this data. You can contact me at any time about this and other questions on the subject of personal data.        
</p>     
<h1>
     2.10 Right to restrict processing   
</h1>  
<p>
You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. To do this, you can contact me at any time. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:<br><br>
1. If you dispute the accuracy of your stored personal data, time is usually needed to verify this. You have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data for the duration of the review.<br>
2. If the processing of your personal data has happened/is happening unlawfully, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of erasure.<br>
3. If your personal data is no longer needed, but you need it to exercise, defend or enforce legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of erasure.<br>
4. If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 DSGVO, a balancing of your and my interests must be carried out. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.<br><br>
If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data may - apart from being stored - only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of an important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.

2.11 SSL or TLS encryption
</h1>   
<p>
This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or enquiries. You can recognise an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from „http://“ to „https://“ and by the lock symbol in your browser line.<br><br> If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.    
</p>  
<h1>
 2.12 Objection to advertising e-mails       
</h1>        
<p>
The use of contact data published within the framework of the imprint obligation to send advertising and information material that has not been expressly requested is hereby prohibited. I expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam e-mails.        
</p>  
<h1>
3 Newsletter
</h1>
<h1>
3.1 Newsletterdaten 
</h1>   
<p>
If you would like to receive the newsletter offered on the website, you will be required to provide an email address and information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the email address provided and that you agree to receive the newsletter. Further data will not be collected or will only be collected on a voluntary basis. This data is used exclusively for sending the requested information and is not passed on to third parties.<br><br> The data entered in the newsletter registration form is processed exclusively on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO). You can revoke your consent to the storage of the data, the e-mail address and their use for sending the newsletter at any time. The legality of the data processing operations already carried out remains unaffected by the revocation. <br><br>The data you provide for the purpose of receiving the newsletter will be stored until you unsubscribe from the newsletter and will be deleted from the newsletter distribution list after you unsubscribe from the newsletter or after the purpose has ceased to exist. I reserve the right to delete or block e-mail addresses from our newsletter distribution list at my own discretion within the scope of my legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. <br><br>Data that has been stored for other purposes remains unaffected by this.<br><br> After you have unsubscribed from the newsletter distribution list, your email address may be stored in a blacklist if this is necessary to prevent future mailings. The data from the blacklist will only be used for this purpose and will not be merged with other data. This serves both your interest and my interest in complying with legal requirements when sending newsletters (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO). The storage in the blacklist is not limited in time. You can object to the storage if your interests outweigh our legitimate interest.
